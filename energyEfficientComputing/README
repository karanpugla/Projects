A Python API to control and configure HAProxy. Interfaced HAProxy and Linux system monitoring using Python to
dynamically offload web application traffic.
A low powered device like Raspberry Pi provides great cost
and energy savings, however it cannot perform computationally
intensive tasks. A good way to combine cost and energy
savings while not compromising on performance is to do of-
floading wherein the Pi performs tasks locally as much as it
can support, post which it offloads to remote machines. A
load balancer on the Pi would decide when to offload, how
much to offload and the duration of the offloading. In this
paper, we are proposing a dynamic offloading algorithm to
dynamically offload CPU intensive as well as Memory intensive
workloads. We also provide a sensitivity analysis to
evaluate the impact of request rates and number of requests
on overall Response Time.
